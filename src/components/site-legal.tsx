      <p>
        Your privacy is the whole point of VoiceRip. This page explains exactly
        what happens when you use it.
      </p>

      <h3>We don’t see your media files. Ever.</h3>
      <p>Audio extraction and stem separation run locally on your device via WebAssembly. The separation model is downloaded to your browser and runs there — your media is never uploaded.</p>
      <p>Your media files are <strong>never uploaded to any server</strong>, never stored, and never transmitted across the network.</p>

      <h3>No accounts, no tracking identifiers</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip does not require sign-up and does not use accounts. It sets no
        cookies that identify you, and collects no name, email, IP address, or
        other personal information.
      </p>

      <h3>What stays on your device</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The media files you choose to work with.</li>
        <li>Any output you choose to save or download.</li>
        <li>Your theme preference, stored locally in your browser.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Closing the tab discards everything from memory. Nothing is written to
        disk by VoiceRip itself beyond what you explicitly save.
      </p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip includes no third-party analytics and no advertising trackers.
        The host it is deployed on (Vercel) records aggregated, anonymous
        infrastructure metrics such as request counts; those never include your
        media files or their contents.
      </p>

      <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip is a general-purpose utility and does not knowingly collect
        data from anyone, including children.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
      <p>
        If this ever changes, this page will be updated. Because the tool is built to run without a server, the core promise — your media files stay on your device — will not change.
      </p>

      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip is open source. For questions about this policy, email{" "}
        <a
          href={`mailto:${FEEDBACK_EMAIL}`}
          className="font-medium text-foreground underline underline-offset-2"
        >
          {FEEDBACK_EMAIL}
        </a>{" "}
        or open an issue on GitHub.
      </p>
    </>

function TermsBody() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>
        By using VoiceRip, you agree to these terms. They’re short on purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>The service</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip is a free, browser-based tool for extracting and separating audio from video. It is provided “as is” and “as available”,
        without warranties of any kind — express or implied — including
        warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>Your content, your responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the media files you use with the tool. Because the
        work happens on your device, you keep full ownership and control of your
        content at all times. You agree that you have the rights to whatever you
        process with it.
      </p>

      <h3>Acceptable use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t use VoiceRip for anything you don’t have the right to do.</li>
        <li>Don’t attempt to abuse, overload, or reverse-engineer the hosting infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Don’t use the tool for any unlawful purpose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Free and open</h3>
      <p>
        VoiceRip is free to use. There are no paid tiers, no watermarks, and no
        usage limits imposed by the tool itself. The source is on GitHub — you
        are welcome to inspect, fork, or self-host it.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the author shall not be liable
        for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising
        from your use of the tool, including loss of data. Keep backups of
        anything you care about.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-party libraries</h3>
      <p>VoiceRip is built on open-source libraries, including ffmpeg.wasm, and ONNX Runtime Web. Each is governed by its own license.</p>

      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>
        These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of
        VoiceRip after a change constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
      </p>
